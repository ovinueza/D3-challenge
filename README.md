# D3-challenge

## Background

This project focuses in analyzing the current trends shaping people's lives, as well as creating charts, graphs, and interactive elements to help people understand information from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System.

The data set is based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates. The current data set incldes data on rates of income, obesity, poverty, etc. by state. MOE stands for "margin of error."

## Task

Create a scatter plot between two of the data variables such as Healthcare vs. Poverty or Smokers vs. Age.

Using D3 techniques, create a scatter plot that represents each state with circle elements.

Include state abbreviations in the circles.

Create and situate the axes and labels to the left and bottom of the chart.



## Result

Multi variable interactive scatter plot
